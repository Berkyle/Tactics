# Tactics
A fresh take on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe, re-imagined in a whole new dimension!

Welcome to Tactics! 

This is the beginnings of Group 1's third project, and will feature a new take on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. This application will be web-based, and thus the platform of this project will be run on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

The final version of Project 3 will feature:
- A classic version of Tic Tac Toe.
- A more complex 9x9 Tic Tac Toe game,
- A user system login interface with a few social tools,
- A user ranking system, 
- Social Media API Integration (Twitter, FB, etc),
- A match history system, and
- A few bots for you to compete against (though you will be able to play with friends)!

Stay tuned!
