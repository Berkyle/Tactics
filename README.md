# Tactics

Welcome to Tactics! 

This is the beginnings of Group 1's third project, and will feature a new take on the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. This application will be web-based, and thus the platform of this project will be run on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

The final version of Project 3 will feature:
- A classic version of Tic Tac Toe.
- A more complex 9x9 Tic Tac Toe game,
- A user system login interface
- A user ranking system, 
- A few bots for you to compete against (though you will be able to play with friends)!

How to play:
3x3 Board:
- This is a simple 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game with all the basic rules.

9x9 Board:
- To win, one must win three 3x3 sub-boards. 
- Where your opponent will play the next move depends on the placement of your current move. For example, if you place an X/O in the top right corner of any box, the next move will have to be in the top right 3x3 box. To win a 3x3 box is the same as winning a simple 3x3 game.
- Every move alternates between X's and O's.

Stay tuned!
